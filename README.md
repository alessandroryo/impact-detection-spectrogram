# Impact Detection on Wind Turbine Blades using Spectrograms

This project leverages **deep learning** to classify **impact events** on **wind turbine blades**, utilizing **spectrogram-based analysis**. The development follows the **CRISP-DM methodology**, ensuring structured and iterative improvements.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`notebooks/`** – Jupyter notebooks structured per iteration following **CRISP-DM**.
- **`src/`** – Core Python scripts for preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
- **`models/`** – Trained models (**excluded from GitHub** for privacy).
- **`config/`** – Configuration files for managing hyperparameters and paths.
- **`scripts/`** – Automation scripts for batch processing and training pipelines.

## 🏗 CRISP-DM Approach

This project is structured into **iterations**, each consisting of:

1. **Data Understanding** – Analyzing raw audio data.
2. **Data Preparation** – Converting audio to spectrograms and feature engineering.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extracting meaningful patterns from spectrograms.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** – Training deep learning models and assessing performance.
5. **Iteration for Improvement** – Refining models and tuning hyperparameters.
